### Abstract ###
In this report we start by explaining the initial problem that was presented to us, which consists of building a Java application that tracked the fastest routes from one point to another in the world so that the delivery of containers is more efficient.
The application must follow a Test Driven Development approach using SonarQube® and Jenkins® servers.
Before coding development, we focused our work on the engineering software artifacts that would be relevant during coding.
All our work was distributed among the seven members of the group and we tried to follow an even distribution, however imperfect.

### Theorical Introduction ###
In this first sprint of the project that was presented to us, it required that we elaborate a product that would support the delivery of containers only by sea. In this service we should be able to import a file that contains a list of ships, and from this list return it to a BST, and basically it should allow the management of ships, dynamic data of ships and containers.


### Work Organization, Planning and Methodology ###
The methodology followed by our group is based on Scrum®, so all our work was developed in a certain way, starting with planning who and what each member of the group would do.
One of the central parts of our team was mutual help, as without it it would be almost impossible to work as a team. In this first sprint, as there was still no great chemistry between some members of the group, there were still some lack of communication, however over these three weeks we tried to help each other with doubts/difficulties.
To help organize the sprint we use Jira Software.

First, we analyze the user stories and then we build the Use Case Diagram shown below.
After that, and following a Scrum methodology, we gave an estimate value so that we could know how long each use case would take.
In the next step the use cases were distributed among the group members.
In the days that followed, each member worked on their use case and whenever someone needed to ask a question or needed help with something, the group would try to help.

Next, we start by elaborating the Use Case diagram, which can be seen below:

With these Use Cases in mind, we strive to build the Software Engineering diagrams.

We created the Domain Model that we would follow in the development of our sprint, which can be seen below:

We created the Global Class Diagram that we would follow in the development of our sprint, which can be seen below:
